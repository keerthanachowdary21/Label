## Objective

To assess your ability to build a simple, functional, and visually appealing table using React. This assignment will evaluate your understanding of React components, state management, and basic styling.


## Table Features

### 1. Column 1 (Label 1)
- Contains a **single select dropdown** to select options from a static list (dummy data can be hardcoded).
- Once an option is selected in one row, it cannot be re-selected in the next row.

### 2. Column 2 (Label 2)
- Contains a **multi-select dropdown** where the user can select multiple options.
- Includes a component at the bottom of the dropdown that allows the user to add a new item to the dropdown list.
- This component should appear at the end of the options list and not as a separate component outside the dropdown.

### 3. Add Button
- A **"Add New Row"** button should be present at the bottom of the table.
- Clicking the button should add a new row to the bottom of the table, allowing the user to select values for both columns.

- **Styling**: Use plain CSS, CSS Modules, or a CSS framework like TailwindCSS or Bootstrap.
- No backend is required; all data can be hardcoded.
